NAME
    zonewalk - recursive DNS zone walk

SYNOPSIS
    zonewalk [-d] [-4] [-6] [-l] [-s server] zone

DESCRIPTION
    This script walks the given zone recursively and prints all the DWIM
    resource records.

    As a convenience, if you specify an ip address as startzone the reverse
    zone is fetched, e.g.

      134.60         does the zonewalk for 60.134.in-addr.arpa
      2001:07c0:0900 does the zonewalk for 0.0.9.0.0.c.7.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa

    The server option is optional. If you don't specify the server, default
    servers are used, as defined by the resolver config file.

    Keep in mind that the server must be authoritative for the zones and the
    client must be allowed to fetch the zones from the authoritative server
    via AXFR.

OPTIONS
    -d
          Enable debug messages

    -4
          Print A records, no AAAA records

    -6
          Print AAAA records, no A records

    -l
          Long zone listing, print all resource records instead of DWIM

    -s server
          DNS server for zone transfers, must be authoritative or authorized

ARGUMENTS
    Define the DNS start zone.

LIMITATIONS
    If IPv6 addresses are given, abbreviated forms are not allowed, .e.g.

      2001:07c0:0900     allowed
      2001:7c0:900   not allowed
